#### The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers. The series starts with 0 and 1, and each subsequent number is obtained by adding the two numbers that came before it. Therefore, the Fibonacci series begins as follows: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on.

#### The sequence is named after Leonardo Fibonacci, an Italian mathematician from the 13th century who introduced the series to the Western world. However, the concept of the Fibonacci sequence had already been studied in various cultures and time periods before Fibonacci's time.

#### Mathematically, the Fibonacci series can be defined using the following recursive formula:

### F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

#### where F(n) represents the nth number in the series. The initial conditions are F(0) = 0 and F(1) = 1, which serve as the starting point for generating the subsequent numbers.

#### One of the fascinating aspects of the Fibonacci series is its prevalence in nature and various other fields. It appears in the growth patterns of many plants, such as the arrangement of leaves on a stem or the spirals in a pinecone or a sunflower. Additionally, the series has connections to art, architecture, and even stock market analysis.

#### The ratio between consecutive Fibonacci numbers approaches a value known as the golden ratio, approximately 1.6180339887. This ratio is considered aesthetically pleasing and is often found in art and design.

#### The Fibonacci series has captured the curiosity and interest of mathematicians, scientists, and enthusiasts alike due to its inherent mathematical beauty, recurring patterns, and widespread occurrence in the natural world.
